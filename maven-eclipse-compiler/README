This module is a Maven compiler which uses the Eclipse Java compiler which is 
used by the Tuscany SCA project build.

To build, from the top maven-eclipse-compiler run maven:

mvn

or once all the dependencies have been downloaded and a succesful build run use:

mvn clean install -o

So as to avoid the Tuscany SCA project using SNAPSHOT dependencies any changes
to this maven-eclipse-compiler module should be released and the Tuscany SCA
project updated to use the newly released version.

To release this module:

mvn release:prepare

followed by: 

mvn release:perform

While running these will prompt you for the names fro the tag, release version etc.

In your maven settings.xml file you must have a server defined named "apache.releases",
and a profile named "release". For example:

  <servers>
    ...
    <server>
      <id>apache.releases</id>
      <username>antelder</username>
      <privateKey>\ant\id_dsa</privateKey>
      <passphrase>xxx</passphrase>
      <directoryPermissions>775</directoryPermissions>
      <filePermissions>664</filePermissions>
    </server>
  </servers>

  <profiles>
    ...
    <profile>
      <id>release</id>
      <properties>
        <gpg.passphrase>...</gpg.passphrase>
        <deploy.altRepository>apache.releases::default::scp://people.apache.org/home/antelder/public_html/tuscany/maven-eclipse-compiler-1.0</deploy.altRepository>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
