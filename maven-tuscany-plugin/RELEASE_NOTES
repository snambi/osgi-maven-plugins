Apache Tuscany Maven Tuscany Plugin 2.0-M4 Release Notes
========================================================

Initial release

This module is a Maven plugin that enables starting a Tuscany runtime
to run SCA contributions.

There are several ways it can be used:

- you can start a Tuscany runtime running an SCA contribution with "mvn tuscany:run" if you 
  include the Tuscany plugin in the a contributions Maven project plugins definition, eg:

   <project...>
      ...
	<build>
            ...
		<plugins>
                  ...
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.apache.tuscany.maven.plugins</groupId>
				<artifactId>maven-tuscany-plugin</artifactId>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>
   </project>

- if you have an SCA contribution file and Maven installed then you can run the contribution
  without needing to any install of a Tuscany distribtion by using the following command:
   
  mvn org.apache.tuscany.maven.plugins:maven-tuscany-plugin:launch -Dcontributions=<filePathToTheContributionFile>

With both of those you can set the domain name used by setting the "domain" system property, for example, the following
will enable the Tribes distributed domain support and start an SCA domain named "myDomain":

  mvn tuscany:run -Ddomain=tribes:myDomain   

If you don't already have the Tuscany modules installed in your local Maven repository they will be downloaded from the
remote repository, on subsequent runs you can use the mvn -o option to disable access to the remote repositories.
