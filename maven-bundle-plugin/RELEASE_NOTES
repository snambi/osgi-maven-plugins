Apache Tuscany Maven Bundle Plugin 1.0.4 Release Notes
======================================================

- Add compile dependencies to the .classpath file if it doesn't supply any packages to the OSGi import. This maks this plugin more closer to the mvn eclipse:eclipse behavior. 
- Exclude the project itself from the resolution so that it can be built offline
- Add support to include different versions of 3rd party jars into the distribution if it is omitted by a lower version in maven
- Check the partial attr to decide if the bundle needs to be required
- Don't generate Import-Package header for the 3rd party jars so that either local package is used if there are split packages
- Add the option to generate a gateway bundle that aggregates split packages and export them
- Fix svn:eol-style and svn:keywords properties for java/xml files
- Add import statement for the generated MF
- Upgrade to Equinox 3.5
